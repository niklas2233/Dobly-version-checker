This is a script that searches the specified or default folder if there is any MKV files that contains Dolby Vision Version 5 and then sends a massage to a Discord channel with Webhook. The reason for this script is to find MKV files that have Dolby Vision version 5 which only contain Dolby Vision and are only playable on Players that support Dolby Vision. While Version 7 and 8 also include normal HDR support. This script notifies via discord that there is a file so you can change the file with something that have version 7 or 8 or doesn’t have Dolby Vision, for example a Plex server where some users might use a device that doesn’t have Dolby Vision support like Samsung TV’s or phones.
FFProbe is required to run this script
